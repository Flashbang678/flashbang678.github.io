<h2>Brotherhood of Steel</h2>
<p>The Brotherhood of Steel is a quasi-religious technological organization operating across the ruins of post-war North America, with its roots stemming from the United States Armed Forces and the government-sponsored scientific community from before the Great War.

<h2>The Enclave</h2>
<p>The Enclave is a secretive political, scientific, and militaristic organization that is descended directly from members of the pre-War United States government, and claims to be the legally-sanctioned continuation of the government, while also styling themselves and their overall demeanor as such.</p>

<h2>NCR</h2>
<p>New California (officially the New California Republic, often abbreviated to NCR) is a large, democratic federation of well over 700,000[2] based in California, with holdings in Nevada, Oregon, Mexico (Baja California) and along the Colorado River. The NCR emphasizes and claims to support a myriad of old world values, such as democracy, personal liberty, and the rule of law. It also strives to restore general order to the wasteland, the improvement and development of infrastructure and economic systems, and a basic common peace between the people. Though appearing to be a benevolent entity of governance, the ability to control the land it claims to protect, the fidelity of those who live under their rule, and the widespread corruption within their political system has been questioned by many, without a clear response by the NCR themselves.</p>

<h2>Caesar's Legion</h2>
<p>Caesar's Legion is an autocratic, traditionalist, imperialistic slaver society, and a totalitarian dictatorship. Founded in 2247 by Edward Sallow (also known as Caesar) and Joshua Graham, it is based on the ancient Roman Empire. Its legionaries are a well organized, culturally insular fighting force that mainly operate east of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon, in the former state of Arizona. Ever pushing west, their capital is the city of Flagstaff.

Caesar's Legion is comprised mostly of reconditioned tribes and their descendants. The Legion's symbol is a golden bull on a red field, which is derived from Julius Caesar's standard for the Tenth Twin Legion.</p>
